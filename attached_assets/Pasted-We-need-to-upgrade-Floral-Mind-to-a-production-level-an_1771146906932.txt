We need to upgrade Floral Mind to a production-level analytics platform.

Major Enhancements Required:

1. Voice Interaction
- Add microphone button in chat panel
- Use browser Web Speech API for speech-to-text
- Send transcript to backend
- Use browser SpeechSynthesis for voice playback of AI response
- Add toggle to mute/unmute voice
- Ensure voice does not autoplay if muted

2. AI Accuracy Measurement
- Track SQL execution success rate
- Log failed queries
- Add confidence scoring system:
  - After generating insight, run internal validation prompt
  - Return confidence score 1–5
- Display small badge:
  "AI Confidence: 4.3/5"

3. Advanced Dashboard Layout System
Replace current fixed grid layout.

Use:
- react-grid-layout (drag and resize enabled)

Requirements:
- User can drag charts
- User can resize charts
- Charts snap to grid
- Different row heights
- Save layout in state

Add layout presets:
- Executive (2 large + 2 small)
- Detailed (4 equal grid)
- Wide mode (1 large full width + 2 half)

4. User Customization Controls
Add dashboard settings panel:
- Select number of charts per row
- Toggle 2D / 3D charts
- Change chart density
- Reset layout button

5. 3D Charts Support
Replace Recharts with Apache ECharts or Plotly.

Requirements:
- Support 3D bar charts
- Support 3D pie charts
- Keep design elegant, not flashy
- Maintain Floral pink theme colors

6. Chart Rendering Fix
Current issue:
Charts are taking full width and layout not working.

Fix:
- Wrap charts in grid item container
- Remove width: 100% override
- Use responsive container properly
- Constrain width and height via grid layout

7. Preserve AI Drilldown Logic
Ensure click events still:
- Trigger new Claude query
- Update chart dynamically
- Add new chart to grid

8. Maintain Performance
- Lazy load charts
- Avoid full re-render of dashboard on each update
- Use memoization where needed

Do not rewrite entire app.
Refactor modularly.

Implement changes step by step.
Ask for confirmation after each major feature.
